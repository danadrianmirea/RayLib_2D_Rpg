# Building
The RPG Example uses premake just like all other items in raylib extras. A tutorial on how to build a raylib project with premake can be found here. https://github.com/raylib-extras/game-premake

### Windows MinGW
Run the premake-mingw.bat and then run make in the folder

### Windows Visual Studio (not VSC)
Run premake-VisualStudio.bat and then open the RPGExample.sln that is generated

### Linux
CD into the directory, run ./premake5 gmake2 and then run make

### MacOS
CD into the directory, run ./premake5.osx gmake2 and then run make


# State
The current example is feature complete and would be considered in 'beta' state. It has all the main features that are required by the game.

# Features
This sample has examples of how to do the following things in raylib

- Game State
- Menus
- Quiting the game from menus
- Pause/Resume Game
- Tile Map with object layers
- Click to Move
- 2D Camera that keeps the player in view
- Simple Effects
- Basic AI
- Background Music
- Sound Effects
- Resource Loading

# C++
This example does use C++. The use of C++ has been keept at a resonable level. C++ is used for

- Containers (vector, list, map, etc...)
- Simple classes
- Menu Screens

Every use of C++ in this project can be replicated in C, or any other language. The main reason for using C++ was to not clutter up the project with implementations of common containers such as linked lists.
Do not fear the C++. C++ is just another tool to use to solve problems.
